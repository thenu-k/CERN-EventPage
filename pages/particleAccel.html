            <h3>Particle Acceleration</h3>

                    Understanding and verifying the fundamental laws of nature requires physical conditions that can only be achieved by colliding particles at awe-some energies. The standard model is the closest framework that has come to describing matter and the four fundamental forces - excluding gravity. To this extent, CERN and its colliders have been instrumental in verifying the theory with its detection of the Higgs Boson. Beyond this, and from questioning matter-antimatter symmetry, to exploring the conditions of the early universe, the range of physics explored at CERN is diverse, and yet at the heart of all these experiment lies particle acceleration.

                    Accelerating particles to near light speeds requires advanced engineering that utilizes many areas of physics. Thus the research conducted at CERN not only furthers our understanding of fundamental physics but also brings about innovation in fields like superconductors and cryogenics. These technologies that were first pioneered at CERN are now used in places like hospital MRI machines to save lives.

                    Consider the production of Higgs Bosons with the LHC at CERN. This requires protons to be accelerated to near light speeds using electrical fields in RF cavities. But before it even reaches the LHC it must go through a series of other accelerators in succession! The protons must also be packed in tight bunches to increase the chances of collisions: this is accomplished using quadrupole magnets. 
                </p>
                <p>
But why do we need a bigger collider to reach faster speeds; can we not accelerate the protons for longer with the same circular collider? What is an RF cavity and why can we not just use a normal electrical field? How do quadrupole magnets work and how are they different from typical dipole magnets? These are questions that one might have about the process of particle acceleration. With the resources below, you can find answers to these questions.                  </p>
