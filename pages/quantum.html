                    Quantum mechanics challenges the deterministic view of nature that physics held for centuries. Like most advancements in physics, this paradigm shift was brought on by experimental observations that were inconsistent with existing theories. Why do gases emit only certain wavelengths of light when heated? Why do electrons behave like waves when passing through slits? How do we model the emission spectrum of an object? Such questions, and the ingenious work of many scientists in the early 20th century laid the foundation for our modern understanding of quantum theory.

                    Results from quantum mechanics have had revolutionary impacts on modern life. The widespread use of computers with semiconductor technology, the LEDs/OLEDs on your phone screens, X-rays and MRI machines, are just a few technologies that can be attributed to quantum mechanics.

                    With all this said, quantum physics is considered to be an unintuitive subject. A combination of unfamiliar rules, and abstract mathematics has made it appear intimidating. But like many theories in science, it is possible to learn the concept at different levels of depth. Complex mathematics provides a useful framework for calculation, but it is very much possible to appreciate the world of quantum mechanics from a non-specialist standpoint.
